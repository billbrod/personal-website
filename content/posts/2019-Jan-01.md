Title: Emacs python setup

I got a new laptop recently and so set up Emacs on it for the first
time. Since my emacs `init.el` file has gotten progressively messier
over the past several years, I took the opportunity to think about the
variety of python packages I use and set things up cleanly. The
following is what I settled on; the steps involved weren't as clear as I
had hoped, so I'm writing this all down in case I need to do it again.

Some notes on how I use Emacs and python before I start:

  - I use `conda` to manage my virtual environments. Most projects, but
    not all, have a corresponding `environment.yml` file in their
    repository. I installed `miniconda` at `~/miniconda3` (conda version
    4.5.12).

  - I do the early parts of my development, the playing around with
    ideas before I start writing scripts, in a Jupyter Notebook. I also
    do the end of my analysis in them, creating plots and putting the
    parts together in them. I keep most of my functions in scripts,
    runnable from the command line so that I can submit them to NYU's
    computing cluster. Therefore, I don't need the full IDE experience;
    I don't need to run a shell session from within Emacs, and I prefer
    using Jupyter to
    [ein](https://github.com/tkf/emacs-ipython-notebook),
    [org-babel](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html),
    or anything similar.

  - I primarily use [el-get](https://github.com/dimitri/el-get/) to
    manage my Emacs packages, falling back on
    [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package) when an
    appropriate `el-get` recipe isn't available. My configurations for
    both of these are very basic (and I installed `use-package` using
    `el-get`).

Because I don't need the full IDE experience and want to use `conda` to
manage my virtual environments, I cannot use
[Elpy](https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy), which combines a variety
of python-related packages together with a minimum of setup difficulty
([here's](https://realpython.com/emacs-the-best-python-editor/) a guide
to getting started with it). So I decided on using
[jedi.el](https://tkf.github.io/emacs-jedi/latest/) (with the [company
backend](https://company-mode.github.io/)) for auto-completion, the
included python-mode (in Emacs 26.1) for basic syntax highlighting,
[conda.el](https://github.com/necaris/conda.el) for managing virtual
environments, and [flycheck](https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/) (with
[pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) and
[flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)) for syntax- and
style-checking. Wanting to use `conda` and the company backend meant
things were slightly more complicated to set up.

First, `conda.el`. This was very straightforward to setup just following
the instructions on the [Github
page](https://github.com/necaris/conda.el#basic-usage). The following is
the relevant block in my `init.el`:

``` elisp
(use-package conda
  :ensure t)
(require 'conda)
;; if you want auto-activation (see below for details), include:
(conda-env-autoactivate-mode t)
(custom-set-variables
 '(conda-anaconda-home "~/miniconda3"))
```

Next, `company-mode` and `jedi.el`, both of which I can install using
`el-get`. (Note that, if you want to use jedi with the company backend,
*do not* install the regular `jedi.el`: you should only install
`company-jedi`, see [this
issue](https://github.com/syohex/emacs-company-jedi/issues/6)).

``` elisp
(setq my:el-get-packages
      '(company-mode))
(el-get-bundle elpa:jedi-core)
(el-get-bundle company-jedi :depends (company-mode))
(eval-after-load "company-jedi"
    '(setq jedi:server-command (list "~/miniconda3/envs/emacs-jedi/bin/python" jedi:server-script)))
(require 'company-jedi)
(el-get 'sync my:el-get-packages)
```

However, I can't use the automatic `jedi:install-server` command, and so
need to do some manual set up. I mostly followed the instructions from
Update 2 of this [stackoverflow
answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21704533), with some changes:

1.  Create a conda environment (for current example the environment is
    named emacs-jedi) by doing: `conda create -n emacs-jedi python`

2.  Install the following python packages: `jedi`, `sexpdata`, `epc`.
    Only `jedi` is on conda, so I did the following: `pip
            install sexpdata epc; conda install jedi`.

3.  Install the jediepcserver. Navigate to the `jedi-core` install
    directory (probably `~/.emacs.d/el-get/jedi-core`; it should contain
    `jediepcserver.py`), then run: `python setup.py install` (note the
    directory has to exist, so the `(el-get-bundle
            elpa:jedi-core)` needs to be run before this).

After doing the above, `company-jedi` should now be setup. The following
are the relevant config blocks in my `init.el`

``` elisp
(add-hook 'conda-postactivate-hook 'jedi:stop-server)
(add-hook 'conda-postdeactivate-hook 'jedi:stop-server)

(defun my/python-mode-hook ()
  (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-jedi))

(add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'my/python-mode-hook)

(add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'jedi:setup)
(setq jedi:complete-on-dot t)
```

Finally, install and set-up flycheck. This is relatively
straightforward: flycheck can be installed using `el-get`:

``` elisp
(setq my:el-get-packages
      '(flycheck))
(el-get 'sync my:el-get-packages)
```

Now, install the pylint and flake8 executables, in the base conda
environment:

``` bash
conda activate base
pip install flake8 pylint
```

And tell flycheck where to find the executables (and add a couple extra
lines of configuration):

``` elisp
(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-flycheck-mode)
(setq-default flycheck-emacs-lisp-load-path 'inherit)
(setq flycheck-flake8-maximum-line-length 99)
(setq flycheck-python-pylint-executable "~/miniconda3/bin/pylint")
(setq flycheck-python-flake8-executable "~/miniconda3/bin/flake8")
```

Once that's done, all you need to do is check things are set up. Open up
any python file in Emacs and type `C-u C-c ! v` to see the status of
flycheck and, if pylint and flake8 are deactivated, type `C-u C-c !
x` to activate them.

If everything works, flycheck will start underlining things in yellow
and red to tell you that things are against the style guide or will
raise errors. If you start to type something, jedi will suggest possible
completions, and all of these will be based on the packages installed in
the appropriate virtual environment.

All told, the following shows the relevant parts of my init file:

``` elisp
(setq my:el-get-packages
      '(company-mode
        flycheck))
(el-get-bundle elpa:jedi-core)
(el-get-bundle company-jedi :depends (company-mode))
(eval-after-load "company-jedi"
    '(setq jedi:server-command (list "~/miniconda3/envs/emacs-jedi/bin/python" jedi:server-script)))
(require 'company-jedi)
(el-get 'sync my:el-get-packages)

(use-package conda
  :ensure t)
(require 'conda)
;; if you want auto-activation (see below for details), include:
(conda-env-autoactivate-mode t)
(custom-set-variables
 '(conda-anaconda-home "~/miniconda3"))
(add-hook 'conda-postactivate-hook 'jedi:stop-server)
(add-hook 'conda-postdeactivate-hook 'jedi:stop-server)

(defun my/python-mode-hook ()
  (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-jedi))

(add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'my/python-mode-hook)
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'jedi:setup)
(setq jedi:complete-on-dot t)

(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-flycheck-mode)
(setq-default flycheck-emacs-lisp-load-path 'inherit)
(setq flycheck-flake8-maximum-line-length 99)
(setq flycheck-python-pylint-executable "~/miniconda3/bin/pylint")
(setq flycheck-python-flake8-executable "~/miniconda3/bin/flake8")
```
