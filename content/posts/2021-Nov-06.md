Title: Scripting figure creation with inkscape and python

I spent some time figuring out how to use inkscape and python to script
the creation of figures that contain bitmaps, allowing for the user to
specify the DPI when embedded. Normally, the way to handle this involves
creating the figures directly in a vector graphics editor like inkscape
or Adobe Illustrator, which works fine, but I like to script as much as
of my workflow as possible, to make testing different figure versions as
quick as possible. I spent probably too much time getting it to work,
but [here's](https://github.com/billbrod/inkscape-figure-example) an
example GitHub repo I made showing how the process works, with some tips
on how to use it yourself.
