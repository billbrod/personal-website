This pages links to miscellaneous projects I've been a part of or put together.

- [[https://scaan.net/waterfrontmap/][Waterfront Justice Project Map]] ([[https://github.com/ScAAN/waterfrontmap][github repo]]), a collaboration between the
  [[https://www.nyc-eja.org/campaigns/waterfront-justice-project/][NYC-EJA]] and [[https://scaan.net/][ScAAN]], this interactive map visualizes the effects of climate
  change and storm surge in New York City's industrial waterfront.
- [[https://www.wfbroderick.com/illusory-grating][Illusory Grating]] ([[https://gitlab.com/billbrod/illusory-grating/][gitlab repo]]): a webapp I put together to visualize a strange
  illusion I found. Note this takes a long time to load.
- [[https://wfbroderick.com/spatial-frequency-model/][Spatial frequency model]] ([[https://github.com/billbrod/spatial-frequency-model][github repo]]): a webapp I put together to explore
  predictions made by different parameter values for my spatial frequency
  preferences paper ([[https://doi.org/10.1167/jov.22.4.3][paper]], [[https://github.com/billbrod/spatial-frequency-preferences][github repo]] with instructions on how to get data and
  use code).
- [[https://www.wfbroderick.com/meal-calendar/][Dinner calendar]] ([[https://github.com/billbrod/meal-calendar/][github repo]]): a visualization using [[https://vega.github.io/][vega]] to see what my
  dinners have been like since Jan 2022. Whether I cooked, was the meal
  vegetarian, etc. Includes links to recipes, where available.
- [[https://wfbroderick.com/book-visualization/][Books]] ([[https://github.com/billbrod/book-visualization/][github repo]]): a visualization using [[https://d3js.org/][d3.js]] to see what books I've read
  since mid-2016 (though I'm pretty sure the data from first several months is
  off).
- [[https://wfbroderick.com/google-ngram-analyzer/][Google ngram analyzer]] ([[https://github.com/billbrod/google-ngram-analyzer][github repo]]): an app using [[https://d3js.org/][d3.js]] to put blocks of text
  through [[https://books.google.com/ngrams][Google Ngram Viewer]], with the goal of helping writers of works set in
  specific historical periods understand whether the words they're using are
  anachronistic or not.
