Summary: List of presentations

This page hosts a list of html presentations that I've made. They're
made using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/); you can
navigate through using your arrow keys, make them full screen by
pressing your F key, and view any speaker notes by pressing S (they will
open as a pop-up). These seem to work best in Chrome or Chromium.

  - [CCN Salon]({static}/presentations/CCN.Salon.2023-08-11.html)
    presentation. Introducing myself to the members of CCN.
  - [Thesis defense public
    talk]({static}/presentations/Thesis.Defense.2022-04-15-no-ackn.html).
    A video recording of this talk can be found [on the Internet
    Archive](https://archive.org/details/broderick_defense) (they'll
    host your stuff for free, forever). The presentation contains
    several very large images, so it may take a bit longer to load.

        version](https://archive.org/details/broderick-2022-effec-foveat-slides)
        of the slides.
  - [First Year
    Talk]({static}/presentations/1st-Year-Talk.2017-10-19.html) (note
    that there's an animated gif about half way through this
    presentation showing my experiment; it's slowed down but it involves
    rapidly flashing black and white gratings, so I'm slightly worried
    it could trigger seizures in people who are particularly
    photosensitive, so be aware).
  - [Overview of spatial frequency
    literature]({static}/presentations/2017-07-24_lab_mtg.html)
  - [Evolution and
    Vision]({static}/presentations/TheoNeuroJC.2017-04-20.html)
