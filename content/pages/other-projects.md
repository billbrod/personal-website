Summary: Links to other projects

This pages links to miscellaneous projects I've been a part of or put
together.

  - [Waterfront Justice Project Map](https://scaan.net/waterfrontmap/)
    ([github repo](https://github.com/ScAAN/waterfrontmap)), a
    collaboration between the
    [NYC-EJA](https://www.nyc-eja.org/campaigns/waterfront-justice-project/)
    and [ScAAN](https://scaan.net/), this interactive map visualizes the
    effects of climate change and storm surge in New York City's
    industrial waterfront.
  - [Illusory Grating](https://www.wfbroderick.com/illusory-grating)
    ([gitlab repo](https://gitlab.com/billbrod/illusory-grating/)): a
    webapp I put together to visualize a strange illusion I found. Note
    this takes a long time to load.
  - [Spatial frequency
    model](https://wfbroderick.com/spatial-frequency-model/) ([github
    repo](https://github.com/billbrod/spatial-frequency-model)): a
    webapp I put together to explore predictions made by different
    parameter values for my spatial frequency preferences paper
    ([paper](https://doi.org/10.1167/jov.22.4.3), [github
    repo](https://github.com/billbrod/spatial-frequency-preferences)
    with instructions on how to get data and use code).
  - [Dinner calendar]({static}/apps/meal-calendar/index.html)
    ([github repo](https://github.com/billbrod/meal-calendar/)): a
    visualization using [vega](https://vega.github.io/) to see what my
    dinners have been like since Jan 2022. Whether I cooked, was the
    meal vegetarian, etc. Includes links to recipes, where available.
  - [Books]({static}/apps/book-visualization/index.html) ([github
    repo](https://github.com/billbrod/book-visualization/)): a
    visualization using [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) to see what books
    I've read since mid-2016 (though I'm pretty sure the data from first
    several months is off).
  - [Google ngram
    analyzer]({static}/apps/google-ngram-analyzer/index.html) ([github
    repo](https://github.com/billbrod/google-ngram-analyzer)): an app
    using [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) to put blocks of text through
    [Google Ngram Viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams), with the
    goal of helping writers of works set in specific historical periods
    understand whether the words they're using are anachronistic or not.
  - [Yiddish wordlist]({static}/apps/yiddish-wordlist/index.html) ([github repo](https://github.com/billbrod/yiddish_wordlist_website)): a simple table showing vocab from some Yiddish short stories.
