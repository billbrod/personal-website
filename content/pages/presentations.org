This page hosts a list of html presentations that I've made. They're
made using [[https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/][reveal.js]]; you can navigate through using your arrow keys,
make them full screen by pressing your F key, and view any speaker
notes by pressing S (they will open as a pop-up).

  through this presentation showing my experiment; it's slowed down
  but it involves rapidly flashing black and white gratings, so I'm
  slightly worried it could trigger seizures in people who are
  particularly photosensitive, so be aware).
