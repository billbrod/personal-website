Title: Presentations
Summary: List of presentations

This page hosts a list of html presentations that I've made. They're
made using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/); you can
navigate through using your arrow keys, make them full screen by
pressing your F key, and view any speaker notes by pressing S (they
will open as a pop-up).

- [First Year Talk]({filename}/presentations/1st-Year-Talk.2017-10-19.html) (note
  that there's an animated gif about half way through this
  presentation showing my experiment; it's slowed down but it involves
  rapidly flashing black and white gratings, so I'm slightly worried
  it could trigger seizures in people who are particularly
  photosensitive, so be aware).
