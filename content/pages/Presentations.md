Title: Presentations
Summary: List of presentations

This page hosts a list of html presentations that I've made. They're
made using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/); you can
navigate through using your arrow keys, make them full screen by
pressing your F key, and view any speaker notes by pressing S (they
will open as a pop-up).
